 * The light direction is fixed (slightly above and to the left, like
 * natural reading light) -- what changes is the surface, not the light.
 *
 * Uses a Blinn-Phong shading model: ambient + diffuse + specular.
 *
 * @param lightDirection Direction FROM the surface TOWARD the light (normalized)
 * @param ambientLight Minimum luminance floor (even in shadow)
 * @param diffuseStrength How much surface angle affects brightness
 * @param specularStrength Intensity of specular highlights
 * @param specularPower Tightness of specular highlights (higher = sharper)
