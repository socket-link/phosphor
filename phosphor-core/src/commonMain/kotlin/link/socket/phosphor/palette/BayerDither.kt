/**
 * Ordered dithering using a 4x4 Bayer matrix.
 *
 * Ordered dithering breaks up banding artifacts in the luminance-to-character
 * quantization. At each screen cell, the fractional part of the scaled luminance
 * is compared against a spatially-varying threshold from the Bayer matrix.
 * This decides whether to round up or down to the adjacent palette entry,
 * producing a stippled mix that simulates intermediate brightness levels.
 *
 * The 4x4 Bayer matrix is tileable and produces a visually pleasing,
 * non-repetitive pattern well suited to ASCII art scales.
